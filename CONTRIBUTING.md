## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** installed on your system
- **Git** for version control
- **Code editor** (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/organizer.git
   cd organizer
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python source/main.py
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- Use **descriptive variable names** and **clear comments**
- Keep functions **focused and small**
- Use **type hints** where appropriate
- Write **docstrings** for functions and classes

**Example:**
```python
def organize_files_by_rule(file_path: str, rule: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Organize a file according to a specific rule.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to organize
        rule: Dictionary containing rule configuration
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if file was successfully organized
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### File Organization

- **`source/main.py`** - Application entry point and system tray logic
- **`source/gui.py`** - User interface components and window management
- **`source/utils.py`** - File operations, configuration, and utility functions
- **`resources/`** - Icons, default configurations, and assets

### Logging

Use the existing logger for consistent logging:
```python
from utils import logger

logger.info("Operation completed successfully")
logger.warning("Potential issue detected")
logger.error("Error occurred during operation")
```

### Configuration

- Configuration is stored in `resources/config.yaml`
- Use `utils.load_config()` and `utils.save_config()` for modifications
- Always validate configuration data before use
